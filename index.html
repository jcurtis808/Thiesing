		<h1>Welcome to Thiesing Veneer</h1>
		<p>
		We are a family owned business located in Mooresville, Indiana and have been in business since 1920. In our production facility we manufacture face veneers for various customers, according to their specifications.  We operate on two shifts in most areas and normally process 220,000 feet of logs per month. 
		<br>
		Our dedicated staff combine modern technology with art, skill and old fashion hard work to constantly ensure your order is filled to the highest quality possible.
		<br>
		The major species that we slice are Oak, Walnut, Maple, Birch, Poplar, Hickory and Cherry with many different slicing options.
		<br>
		Veneer is one of the best uses of our forest resources.  The industry encourages growth of forests and is actively and continually engaged in planting new trees. At Thiesing Veneer no part of the raw material goes unused. We reclaim all wood waste and use it as fuel for processing veneer and heating our facility.
		<br>
		Wood is a renewable resource that provides a spectrum of warmth and character that can be enjoyed for centuries. Our manufacturing techniques capture the highest yields out of each log, thus minimizing waste.
		<br>
		One log can create enough veneer to make several hundred faces.
		</p>

		<p>"Exacting skill and pride of workmanship are woven into the fibers of Thiesing productsâ€¦
		<br>
		From log arrival to delivery at your plant, there is no substitute for our experience and technology when you want a superior product."
