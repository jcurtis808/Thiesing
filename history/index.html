		<h1>the History of Thiesing Veneer Co.</h1>
		<p>Thiesing Veneer Company was founded in 1920 by Louis Thiesing of Indiana. Thiesing started by doing custom cutting at Indiana Veneer Company. With more experience and a larger customer base, Louis moved to his own facility in Indianapolis. In 1924 Thiesing had built a competitive business based upon his own veneer production. In 1938 the company ownership advanced a generation to Louis's daughter Elsie and her husband Robert Mathers.</p>
		<p>In the 1960's the construction of Interstate 70 forced Thiesing from its Indianapolis location to its current facility in Mooresville, Indiana. A decade later the recession in the 1970's forced Thiesing to suspend operations. When the economy got back on track the plant reopened as strictly a custom cutting veneer mill and continues in that tradition today.</p>
		<p>Over the last several decades, Thiesing has been owned and operated by the third generation, Robert and Elsie's three children: James, David and Bobbi. Under their leadership the company has continued to grow and prosper utilizing new technology and adapting to changing markets to meet customer needs.</p>
		<p>Thiesing again stands ready to pass the torch of leadership to the next generation, the fourth. Building off a strong foundation, they plan to run the company with Thiesing Veneer's long standing mission statement in mind.</p>
		<blockquote>"Exacting skill and pride of workmanship are woven into the fibers of Thiesing productsâ€¦ From log arrival to delivery at your plant. There is no substitute for our experience and technology when you want a superior product."</blockquote>
